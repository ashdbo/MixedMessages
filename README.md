Mixed Messages is a portfolio project at the end of Module 11 in Codecademy's Full-Stack Pro Course. The brief of the project was to create a random messsage generator
that had at least 3 different pieces of data. For my project I chose to create a random T-shirt design generator that randomly chose two colors and one pattern for a t-shirt.
